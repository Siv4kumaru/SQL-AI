# SQLAI ü§ñ

**Interact with your database using natural language queries powered by AI!**

SQLAI is a Streamlit-based web application that lets you upload CSV files, store them in a SQLite database, and query them using plain English. Leveraging the power of xAI's Grok and LangChain, it converts your questions into SQL queries and displays the results‚Äîall in a sleek, user-friendly interface.

---

## Features ‚ú®

- **Natural Language Queries**: Ask questions like "Show me all entries where price > 100" and get SQL results.
- **CSV Upload**: Upload CSV files (up to 200MB) and automatically convert them into database tables.
- **Dynamic Schema**: View your database schema and select tables to query.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Handles empty files, encoding issues, and SQL execution errors gracefully.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: See generated SQL queries and their results side-by-side.
- **Powered by AI**: Uses `deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b` via LangChain for smart query generation.
